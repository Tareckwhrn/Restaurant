            You need to include this script tag on any page that has a Google Map.

            The following script tag will work when opening this example locally on your computer.
            But if you use this on a localhost server or a live website you will need to include an API key. 
            Sign up for one here (it's free for small usage): 
                https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key

            After you sign up, use the following script tag with YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY replaced with your actual key.
                <script type="text/javascript" src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"></script>
